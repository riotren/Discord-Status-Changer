# Discord-Status-Changer
status changer for discord, works with node-fetch@2

against ToS, so do this carefully. API will only pick you up if status changes are too frequent, so only do this like every hour or so if youre gonna do it
i would recommend not hosting this on a public hosting site since it contains your token. i would do it on a VPS or keep it in the background since its fairly lightweight
